# ck_react_portfolio

Updated portfolio with react functionality.

To start the code: 
Switch to the react_portfolio folder inside the application.  This was created by: npx create-react-app
Run the command `npm i bootstrap dotenv axios --save` to add dependencies that we will need in later activities.
Run `npm start` to ensure that the source files were transplanted successfully.
